//: # Basic Operators

/*:

* An operator is a special symbol or phrase that you use to check, change, or combine values.
* +, -, *, /, %, &&, detect and disallow value overflow (use Overflow operators)
* % can be performed on floating-point numbers.
* Two range operators: a..<b a...b
* The assignment operator (=) does not return a value, to prevent it from being mistakenly used when the equal to operator (==) is intended.

*/


//: # Terminology
/*:
- Operators are unary, binary and ternary:
* Unary - operate on a single target prefix (!b) or postfix (i++)
* Binary - operate on two targets. infix
* ternary - operate on three targets. One ternary operator: a ? b : c
